    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>There are tons of machine learning algorithms out there and a lot of them were built to accomplish the same goals. Here, we will discuss some popular machine learning algorithms, provide a high-level overview of them, when to use the algorithm, and some pros and cons.</p>

    <h1>Understanding Your Data</h1>
    <p>The first step in choosing a machine learning algorithm is to narrow down the desired task. There are two possibilties:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Predicting a Category</li>
    <li>Not Predicting a Category</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are predicting a category you now need to look at the labels of your data:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Labeled</li>
    <li>Unlabeled</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have labeled data then you need to follow a <b>classification</b> approach. If you have unlabeled data you need to follow a <b>clustering</b> approach.</p>
    <p>If you are not predicting a category you will follow a <b>regression</b> approach.</p>

    <h1>Algorithms</h1>
    <h4>Linear Regression:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Type:</b> Supervised Learning, Regression Algorithm</li>
    <li><b>Description:</b> Linear Regression is a regression algorithm used to estimate real values, e.g. the price of a house, using a regression line of the form $Y=mX+b$ where all variables have continuous values.</li>
    <li><b>When to use it:</b> Linear Regression should be used when there is a linear relationship between the variables in the dataset. The linear regression algorithm fits a line of best fit to a dataset, so if you are sure that your data is correlated linearly then this is a good algorithm to use. For example, house prices are usually linearly correlated with square feet. If the house is larger then it generally costs more. Using linear regression makes sense in this case.</li>
    <li><b>Pros: </b>When the relationship betwen variables is linear the results are most always optimal. It is a very simple and computationally inexpensive algorithm to implement.  </li>
    <li><b>Cons: </b>If your dataset has an outlier then this can skew the regression line and cause poor performance. Additionally, whenever a linear regression model is fit to a group of data, the range of the data should be carefully observed. Attempting to use a regression equation to predict values outside of this range is often inappropriate, and may yield incredibly wrong answers. Linear regression also only looks at linear relationships. If the data has a curve to it or is not exactly linear then this model is not going to produce great performance measurments like some others might.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Decision Trees:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Type:</b> </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Random Forest:</h4>
    <h4>Logistic Regression:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Type: </b> 
    </ul>
    <h4>Naive Bayes:</h4>
    <h4>Support Vector Machines:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Type:</b> Supervised, Classification Algorithm</li>
    </ul>
